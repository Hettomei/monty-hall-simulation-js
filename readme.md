node index.js

Continuous Output with something like :

```
{ winIfKeep: 1308346392, winIfChange: 2616653608 }
{ freqKeep: '33.33367', freqChange: '66.66633' }
{ winIfKeep: 1310012447, winIfChange: 2619987553 }
{ freqKeep: '33.33365', freqChange: '66.66635' }
{ winIfKeep: 1311681014, winIfChange: 2623318986 }
{ freqKeep: '33.33370', freqChange: '66.66630' }
{ winIfKeep: 1313348195, winIfChange: 2626651805 }
{ freqKeep: '33.33371', freqChange: '66.66629' }
```

It means that people had more chance to win the Car
if they change door

I would say 1/3 to win if keep and 2/3 to win if change
